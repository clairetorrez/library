# MyLibrary

**MyLibrary** is a high-performance Go library that simplifies data transformation and validation for backend services. It provides an intuitive API to clean, format, and verify complex datasets with minimal code and maximum efficiency.

## Motivation

In many projects, data transformation and validation are tedious and error-prone tasks that require a lot of repetitive code. Existing solutions are either too heavyweight or too generic, making it difficult to write clean, maintainable code quickly.

I built **MyLibrary** because I wanted a lightweight, efficient toolkit that empowers developers to focus on their core logic without worrying about boilerplate data handling. Whether youâ€™re building APIs, data pipelines, or backend services, this library helps you reduce bugs and speed up development by providing reliable, reusable components for common data operations.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Install MyLibrary using the Go toolchain

go get github.com/yourusername/mylibrary

## Use MyLibrary in your Go project

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/yourusername/mylibrary"
)

func main() {
    result := mylibrary.DoSomething("example input")
    fmt.Println(result)
}

## ðŸ“– Usage

MyLibrary provides several options and functions to help you transform and validate data with ease.

### Available features:

- `CleanData(input string) string` â€” Sanitizes input by removing unwanted characters.
- `ValidateFormat(input string) bool` â€” Checks if the input matches expected formats.
- `TransformCase(input string, mode string) string` â€” Converts text to uppercase, lowercase, or title case.
- `BatchProcess(inputs []string) []string` â€” Processes multiple inputs efficiently.

### Configuration options:

- `MaxRetries` (int) â€” Number of retry attempts on failure (default 3)
- `Timeout` (duration) â€” Maximum wait time for operations (default 5s)
- `EnableLogging` (bool) â€” Toggle verbose logging (default false)

## Examples

### Clean and validate a single string

cleaned := mylibrary.CleanData("  Hello, World!  ")
isValid := mylibrary.ValidateFormat(cleaned)
fmt.Println(cleaned, isValid)

## Transform text to title case

title := mylibrary.TransformCase("hello world from golang", "title")
fmt.Println(title) // Hello World From Golang

## Process a batch of strings

inputs := []string{"input1", "input2", "input3"}
results := mylibrary.BatchProcess(inputs)
fmt.Println(results)
