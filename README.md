# MyLibrary

**MyLibrary** is a high-performance Go library that simplifies data transformation and validation for backend services. It provides an intuitive API to clean, format, and verify complex datasets with minimal code and maximum efficiency.

## Motivation

In many projects, data transformation and validation are tedious and error-prone tasks that require a lot of repetitive code. Existing solutions are either too heavyweight or too generic, making it difficult to write clean, maintainable code quickly.

I built **MyLibrary** because I wanted a lightweight, efficient toolkit that empowers developers to focus on their core logic without worrying about boilerplate data handling. Whether youâ€™re building APIs, data pipelines, or backend services, this library helps you reduce bugs and speed up development by providing reliable, reusable components for common data operations.
